# CLAUDE.md - Development Guidelines for Peer Share

This file provides context for AI assistants (Claude, etc.) working on this codebase.

## Project Overview

Peer Share is an Obsidian plugin that enables peer-to-peer file sharing between vaults using WebRTC. It uses the PairDrop protocol for signaling/peer discovery.

### Key Components

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `src/main.ts` | Plugin entry point, event handlers, UI coordination |
| `src/signaling.ts` | WebSocket connection to PairDrop server, device pairing |
| `src/peer-manager.ts` | Manages peer connections and file transfers |
| `src/rtc-peer.ts` | WebRTC data channel, PairDrop file transfer protocol |
| `src/modals/*.ts` | UI modals (peer selection, file picker, transfer, pairing, confirm) |
| `src/types.ts` | TypeScript interfaces and PairDrop message types |
| `src/logger.ts` | Configurable logging system |
| `src/settings.ts` | Plugin settings UI |
| `src/i18n/` | Internationalization system with English and French translations |

## PairDrop Protocol

The plugin implements the PairDrop signaling protocol:

### Connection Flow
1. Connect to WebSocket at `wss://server/server?webrtc_supported=true`
2. Receive `ws-config` with RTC configuration
3. Receive `display-name` with assigned peer ID
4. Send `join-ip-room` to join room based on IP
5. Receive `peers` list of other peers in room

### Message Types (Server → Client)
- `ws-config` - RTC config and WS fallback settings
- `display-name` - Assigned identity (peerId, peerIdHash, displayName)
- `peers` - List of peers in room (includes roomType, roomId)
- `peer-joined` - New peer entered room (includes roomType, roomId)
- `peer-left` - Peer left room
- `signal` - WebRTC signaling (offer/answer/ICE)
- `ping` - Keepalive (must respond with `pong`)
- `pair-device-initiated` - Pairing code generated (pairKey, roomSecret)
- `pair-device-joined` - Pairing successful (roomSecret, peerId)
- `pair-device-join-key-invalid` - Invalid pairing code
- `pair-device-canceled` - Pairing canceled
- `secret-room-deleted` - Paired room removed

### Message Types (Client → Server)
- `join-ip-room` - Join room based on IP address
- `room-secrets` - Join paired device rooms (array of roomSecrets)
- `room-secrets-deleted` - Leave paired device rooms
- `pair-device-initiate` - Request a pairing code
- `pair-device-join` - Join with a pairing code (pairKey)
- `pair-device-cancel` - Cancel pairing attempt
- `pong` - Keepalive response
- `signal` - WebRTC signaling (requires `to`, `roomType`, `roomId`)
- `disconnect` - Graceful disconnect

### WebRTC Signaling Format
```typescript
// Offer/Answer
{ type: 'signal', to: peerId, roomType: 'ip', roomId: '127.0.0.1', sdp: RTCSessionDescription }

// ICE Candidate
{ type: 'signal', to: peerId, roomType: 'ip', roomId: '127.0.0.1', ice: RTCIceCandidate }
```

## File Transfer Protocol (PairDrop Compatible)

Over the WebRTC data channel, using PairDrop's protocol for compatibility with web/mobile apps:

### Transfer Flow
1. **Sender** sends `request` with file headers array, totalSize, imagesOnly flag
2. **Receiver** shows accept/reject modal
3. **Receiver** sends `files-transfer-response` with accepted: true/false
4. **Sender** sends files sequentially:
   - `header` with name, mime, size
   - Binary chunks (64KB each)
   - `partition` every 1MB (flow control)
   - **Receiver** responds with `partition-received`
   - **Receiver** sends `progress` updates
   - **Receiver** sends `file-transfer-complete` when file done
5. Repeat for each file

### Message Types (Data Channel)
```typescript
// Request to send files
{ type: 'request', header: [{name, mime, size}], totalSize, imagesOnly }

// Accept/reject response
{ type: 'files-transfer-response', accepted: boolean, reason?: string }

// File header (before each file's data)
{ type: 'header', name, mime, size }

// Flow control (every 1MB)
{ type: 'partition', offset }
{ type: 'partition-received', offset }

// Progress update
{ type: 'progress', progress: 0-1 }

// File complete
{ type: 'file-transfer-complete' }

// Transfer cancelled by sender
{ type: 'transfer-canceled' }

// Display name change
{ type: 'display-name-changed', displayName }
```

## Development Commands

```bash
npm install      # Install dependencies
npm run dev      # Watch mode for development
npm run build    # Production build
npx eslint src/  # Run ESLint (must pass before submission)
```

## ESLint Configuration

The project uses `eslint-plugin-obsidianmd` with TypeScript type-checked rules for Obsidian community plugin submission compliance.

**Config**: `eslint.config.mjs` includes:
- `typescript-eslint` recommendedTypeChecked rules
- `obsidianmd` recommended rules
- Custom rules for console usage and unused vars

**Key lint rules to be aware of:**
- No `console.log` - use `console.debug`, `console.warn`, or `console.error`
- No floating promises - use `void` or `await`
- No inline styles - use `setCssProps()` for dynamic styles or CSS classes
- No TFile/TFolder casts - use `instanceof` checks
- Command IDs must not include plugin ID (Obsidian adds it automatically)
- UI text must use sentence case
- Use `activeDocument`/`activeWindow` instead of `document`/`window`

## Code Conventions

### Obsidian API
- Use `registerEvent()` for event listeners (auto-cleanup)
- Use `addCommand()` for command palette entries
- Use `Notice` for user notifications
- Extend `Modal` for dialogs

### TypeScript
- Strict mode enabled
- Use `instanceof` checks for Obsidian types (TFile, TFolder) - never cast
- Handle optional chaining for nullable values
- Prefix unused parameters with `_` (e.g., `_event`)
- Type `JSON.parse()` results explicitly (e.g., `as MyType`)

### Promises & Async
- Fire-and-forget promises must use `void` operator: `void this.doAsync()`
- Async callbacks in event handlers need IIFE wrapper:
  ```typescript
  button.onclick = () => {
    void (async () => {
      await doSomething();
    })();
  };
  ```
- Never use async directly in callbacks that expect void return

### Styles & DOM
- Use `setCssProps()` for dynamic styles: `el.setCssProps({ '--width': '50%' })`
- Use CSS classes for static styles, not inline `style.property`
- Use `activeDocument` and `activeWindow` instead of global `document`/`window`
- Use Obsidian DOM helpers: `createDiv()`, `createSpan()`, `createEl()`

### Commands
- Command IDs must NOT include plugin ID (Obsidian prefixes automatically)
- Good: `id: 'show-peers'` → becomes `peer-share:show-peers`
- Bad: `id: 'peer-share-show-peers'` → becomes `peer-share:peer-share-show-peers`

### Logging
- Use `logger` from `src/logger.ts` (not console.log directly)
- Log levels: `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`, `none`
- User configurable in settings
- Show user-facing errors with `new Notice('Peer Share: ...')`
- Use timeouts for async operations that may hang

### Internationalization (i18n)
- Use `t()` function from `src/i18n` for translating strings
- Use `tp()` function for pluralized strings (e.g., "1 file" vs "2 files")
- Translation keys defined in `src/i18n/locales/en.ts` (source of truth)
- Current supported languages: English (en), Spanish (es), German (de), French (fr), Russian (ru), Japanese (ja), Korean (ko), Simplified Chinese (zh-CN)
- Language auto-detected from Obsidian's language setting via `moment.locale()`
- Pluralization rules vary by language (simplified implementation):
  - English: 1 vs 2+ (suffix 's')
  - Spanish: 1 vs 2+ (suffix 's')
  - German: 1 vs 2+ (suffix 'e')
  - French: 0-1 vs 2+ (suffix 's')
  - Russian: 1 vs 2+ (suffix 'а', simplified from full 3-form rules)
  - Japanese: No plural suffixes
  - Korean: No plural suffixes
  - Chinese: No plural suffixes
- To add a new language: Create `src/i18n/locales/[code].ts` and add to `translations` object in `src/i18n/index.ts`

## Common Issues & Solutions

### "Unknown message type ws-config"
The plugin wasn't handling PairDrop's initial messages. Fixed by adding handlers for `ws-config` and `display-name`.

### Peers don't see each other
Must send `join-ip-room` after receiving `display-name`. Peers are grouped by IP address on the server.

### WebRTC signals not delivered in multi-room scenarios
**Problem**: When connected to multiple rooms (IP room + paired device rooms), WebRTC signaling was using incorrect room information. The signaling client tracked only the "current" room, which got overwritten each time a new `peers` message arrived.

**Solution** (Fixed in v0.1.3): Track `roomType` and `roomId` for each individual peer in `peer-manager.ts` using the `peerRooms` map. Pass per-peer room info when creating RTCPeer instances and sending signals. This ensures paired device connections use secret room signaling while local network connections use IP room signaling.

**Files**: `src/peer-manager.ts`, `src/rtc-peer.ts`, `src/signaling.ts`

### Discovery mode isolation
**Problem**: When switching between 'auto' and 'paired-only' discovery modes, the client cleared local peers but didn't leave the IP room on the server side (PairDrop protocol doesn't support leaving individual rooms without disconnecting).

**Solution** (Fixed in v0.1.2): Make `switchDiscoveryMode()` async and reconnect when switching modes. This ensures only the appropriate rooms are joined based on the new discovery mode.

**Files**: `src/signaling.ts`, `src/peer-manager.ts`, `src/settings.ts`

### Paired device badge not showing
**Problem**: The paired device badge in the peer list used display name matching to determine if a peer is paired. This caused the badge to not appear until the paired device's display name was updated.

**Solution** (Fixed in v0.1.4): Use the `roomSecret` tracking - if a peer has a roomSecret (is in a secret room), it's a paired device. The badge now appears immediately when the peer connects.

**File**: `src/modals/peer-modal.ts`

### Transfer completes but UI stuck
Race condition - transfer may complete before modal is created. Fixed by implementing request/accept flow.

### querySelector fails on filenames
Filenames with special characters (quotes, brackets) break CSS selectors. Use `CSS.escape()`.

### Peer list shows stale peers after disconnect
The `disconnect()` method was removing the `onclose` handler before the WebSocket closed, preventing the `disconnected` event from firing. Fixed by manually triggering the event after setting `ws = null`.

### Custom display names cause complexity
Custom display names required proactive WebRTC connections and added timing issues. Removed in favor of server-assigned names for simplicity and stability.

### Empty files (0 bytes) handling
Empty files cause issues with PairDrop protocol and WebRTC data channels. Solution: Filter out empty files before transfer in `main.ts` `sendToPeer()` method. Users are notified when empty files are skipped. This prevents stalls and ensures compatibility with PairDrop web/mobile apps.

### Incoming transfer modal dismiss handling
**Problem**: When users closed the incoming transfer modal by clicking the X button, pressing ESC, or clicking outside the modal, the transfer remained in limbo without being explicitly rejected.

**Solution** (Fixed in v0.1.9): Added a `resolved` flag to track whether the user explicitly accepted or declined. In the `onClose()` method, if `resolved` is still `false`, automatically call `onReject()` to properly reject the transfer. This ensures transfers are always handled regardless of how the modal is dismissed.

**File**: `src/modals/incoming-transfer-modal.ts`

### Duplicate transfer rejection notices
**Problem**: When a transfer was rejected, two notices appeared: "Transfer rejected" and "Transfer declined".

**Solution** (Fixed in v0.1.9): Removed the duplicate notice in the rejection callback. The `rejectTransfer()` method triggers a 'transfer-rejected' event that shows its own notice, making the manual notice redundant.

**File**: `src/main.ts`

### File already exists error on duplicate files
**Problem**: When receiving files with names that already exist in the vault, a race condition could occur where multiple files tried to create the same filename simultaneously, causing "File already exists" errors.

**Solution**: Implemented proper race condition handling in `saveReceivedFile()` method. The solution wraps `vault.createBinary()` in a try-catch block and retries with incremented filenames (e.g., "file 1.md", "file 2.md") if the creation fails due to race conditions. This matches Obsidian's native duplicate file naming convention. Additionally, when a file is renamed, a `file-renamed` event is emitted and the transfer modal displays "Saved as: [new name]" in orange italic text to inform the user.

**Files**: `src/peer-manager.ts`, `src/main.ts`, `src/modals/transfer-modal.ts`, `styles.css`

### Sender cancellation not notifying receiver
**Problem**: When the sender cancelled a transfer (by clicking Cancel, X button, ESC, or clicking outside the modal), the receiver was not notified. This left the receiver's modal open in a stuck state, and if they accepted the transfer, it would hang indefinitely.

**Solution**: Implemented a complete sender-to-receiver cancellation flow:
1. Added `PairDropTransferCanceled` message type to the protocol
2. Added `cancelTransfer()` method to RTCPeer that sends the cancel message and clears transfer state
3. Added `handleTransferCanceled()` handler on receiver side to clean up state and emit event
4. Wired up cancel callbacks in TransferModal to call `cancelTransfer()` when modal is closed (via any method)
5. Added `transfer-canceled` event handler in main.ts to close both incoming and progress modals
6. Added `isCancelled` flag to prevent duplicate cancel notifications
7. Translated "Transfer cancelled by sender" message to all 8 supported languages

When sender cancels at any point, the receiver's modal automatically closes and they see a notice explaining the sender cancelled the transfer.

**Files**: `src/types.ts`, `src/rtc-peer.ts`, `src/peer-manager.ts`, `src/main.ts`, `src/modals/transfer-modal.ts`, `src/i18n/locales/*.ts`

### Command IDs changed (v0.1.25)
**Breaking Change**: Command IDs were updated to comply with Obsidian plugin guidelines. Users with custom hotkeys will need to reassign them.

| Old ID | New ID |
|--------|--------|
| `peer-share:peer-share-show-peers` | `peer-share:show-peers` |
| `peer-share:peer-share-current-file` | `peer-share:share-current-file` |
| `peer-share:peer-share-files` | `peer-share:share-files` |
| `peer-share:peer-share-reconnect` | `peer-share:reconnect` |
| `peer-share:peer-share-pair-device` | `peer-share:pair-device` |
| `peer-share:peer-share-toggle-connection` | `peer-share:toggle-connection` |
| `peer-share:peer-share-open-history` | `peer-share:open-history` |

**Files**: `src/main.ts`

### Display name not updating on reconnect
**Problem**: The "You appear as..." text in the peer modal would show stale data when disconnected and wouldn't update when reconnecting to the server.

**Solution** (Fixed in v0.1.20):
1. Clear `displayName`, `peerId`, and `peerIdHash` on disconnect in signaling.ts
2. Add `displayNameEl` reference in peer modal to update the display name dynamically
3. Create `updateDisplayName()` method to refresh the display name text
4. Listen to `display-name-updated` events from peer manager
5. Forward `display-name` events from signaling layer to peer manager
6. Update display name on connect, disconnect, and display-name-updated events

The display name now updates correctly when connecting, disconnecting, or reconnecting.

**Files**: `src/signaling.ts`, `src/peer-manager.ts`, `src/modals/peer-modal.ts`

## Security & Encryption

Peer Share uses WebRTC's built-in encryption for secure peer-to-peer transfers:

### Encryption Layers
- **Signaling Channel**: WSS (WebSocket Secure) - TLS encrypted connection to PairDrop server
- **WebRTC Handshake**: DTLS (Datagram TLS) - Automatic key exchange
- **File Transfer**: SRTP (Secure Real-time Transport Protocol) - AES-128+ encryption

### What the Server Sees
- **CAN see**: Peer IDs, display names, room membership, connection timing, IP addresses (for STUN)
- **CANNOT see**: File contents, file names, file sizes, any transfer data

### Key Security Points
- WebRTC encryption is **mandatory and automatic** in modern implementations
- Uses industry-standard ciphers (AES-GCM, ChaCha20-Poly1305)
- Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) via ephemeral key exchange
- Files **never** pass through the signaling server - only direct peer-to-peer
- More private than HTTPS file uploads (server sees only metadata, not files)

For detailed security information, see **SECURITY.md**.

## Testing

## Share History

The plugin includes a comprehensive transfer history system that tracks all sent and received files.

### Architecture

**Files**:
- `src/share-history.ts` - ShareHistory class with persistence and data management
- `src/views/share-history-view.ts` - ShareHistoryView sidebar UI component
- `src/types.ts` - ShareHistoryEntry, ShareHistoryFile, ShareHistorySettings types
- `.obsidian/plugins/peer-share/share-history.json` - Persistent storage file

### Data Model

Each history entry tracks:
- **Core info**: Unique ID, timestamp, direction (sent/received), status (completed/failed/cancelled)
- **Peer info**: Display name, OS, browser/app, device type, paired status, peer ID (optional)
- **Transfer info**: Array of files (name, size, vault path for received files), total size, duration
- **Error info**: Error message if transfer failed

### Features

**ShareHistory Class** (`src/share-history.ts`):
- `load()` / `save()` - Persistence to JSON file
- `addEntry()` - Add new transfer to history
- `getEntries()` - Retrieve all history entries
- `filterEntries()` - Search and filter by direction, peer, status, date, search term
- `deleteEntry()` / `clearAll()` - Remove entries
- `exportAsJson()` / `importFromJson()` - Backup/restore
- `getStatistics()` - Generate transfer stats (total sent/received, success rate, top peers)
- `cleanupOldEntries()` - Auto-remove entries based on retention policy
- `updateSettings()` - Apply new retention/privacy settings

**ShareHistoryView Component** (`src/views/share-history-view.ts`):
- **Time grouping**: Entries grouped by Today, Yesterday, This Week, This Month, Older
- **Search & filter**: Filter by direction (sent/received), status (completed/failed/cancelled), and search text
- **Expandable entries**: Multi-file transfers can be expanded to show all files
- **Context menus**:
  - Per-entry: Share Again (sent files), Reveal in Vault (received files), Delete
  - Top menu: View Statistics, Export/Import History, Clear All
- **Visual indicators**: Color-coded status (green=completed, red=failed, orange=cancelled)
- **Peer metadata display**: Shows "Peer Name (OS • Browser)" for each transfer

**Integration** (`src/main.ts`):
- `ActiveTransfer` interface tracks ongoing transfers (peerId, peer info, files, direction, start time)
- `trackOutgoingTransfer()` - Called when send starts
- `trackIncomingTransfer()` - Called when receive accepted
- `completeTransfer()` - Called on success/failure/cancellation, calculates duration and saves to history
- History tracked automatically for all transfer types (manual, auto-accept, cancelled)

### Privacy Controls

- **Peer ID tracking**: Optional, disabled by default (privacy-first)
- **Retention policy**: Auto-cleanup old entries (7/30/90/180/365 days or forever)
- **Export/import**: Users can backup and restore history
- **Manual deletion**: Delete individual entries or clear all

### UI/UX Enhancements

### Incoming Transfer Modal
- **Clickable "...and X more" expansion**: Shows first 5 files by default, click to expand and view all files
- **Proper dismiss handling**: Closing modal (X button, ESC, click outside) properly rejects transfer
- **Visual feedback**: Accent color and hover effects on expandable elements

### File Picker Modal
- **Clickable file labels**: Click on file/folder name or icon to toggle checkbox selection
- **Improved accessibility**: Larger click target area for better UX

### Log Level Settings
- **Descriptive labels**: Clear indication of what each log level includes (e.g., "Warning (+ Errors)")
- **User-friendly**: Easier to understand logging verbosity options

### System Notifications
- **OS-level alerts**: Optional desktop notifications for incoming transfers
- **Persistent notifications**: Stay visible until user interacts (requireInteraction: true)
- **Smart timing**: Only shown for non-auto-accepted transfers

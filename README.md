## Installation

[Install from community.obsidian.md](https://community.obsidian.md/plugins/peer-share)

From Obsidian's settings or preferences:

1. Community Plugins > Browse
2. Search for "Peer Share"

Manually:

1. download the latest [release](https://github.com/gapmiss/peer-share/releases/latest) archive
2. uncompress the downloaded archive
3. move the `peer-share` folder to `/path/to/vault/.obsidian/plugins/` 
4.  Settings > Community plugins > reload **Installed plugins**
5.  enable plugin

or:

1.  download `main.js`, `manifest.json` & `styles.css` from the latest [release](https://github.com/gapmiss/peer-share/releases/latest)
2.  create a new folder `/path/to/vault/.obsidian/plugins/peer-share`
3.  move all 3 files to `/path/to/vault/.obsidian/plugins/peer-share`
4.  Settings > Community plugins > reload **Installed plugins**
5.  enable plugin

## Usage

### Sharing Files

1. Click the Peer Share icon in the ribbon (left sidebar)
2. Select a peer from the list of discovered devices
3. Choose files or folders to share
4. Monitor transfer progress

### Alternative Methods

- **Context Menu**: Right-click any file/folder and select "Share via Peer Share"
- **Command Palette**: Use `Ctrl/Cmd + P` and search for "Peer Share"
  - `Show available peers` - Open peer selection
  - `Share current file` - Share the currently open file
  - `Share files...` - Open file picker
  - `Open share history` - View transfer history
  - `Reconnect to server` - Manually reconnect
  - `Pair with device` - Pair for cross-network sharing
  - `Toggle connection` - Connect or disconnect from server
- **Status Bar**: Click the status bar item for quick access to connect/disconnect, show peers, pair, and view your display name

### Receiving Files

When someone sends you files:
1. An incoming transfer dialog will appear
2. Review the files being sent
3. Click "Accept" to receive or "Decline" to reject
4. Files are saved to your configured save location (default: `Peer Share/`)

### Device Pairing

Pair devices to share files across different networks:

1. Run command `Peer Share: Pair with device`
2. Choose "Show pairing code" on one device
3. Enter the 6-digit code on the other device
4. Devices are now paired and can discover each other from anywhere

Manage paired devices in Settings > Peer Share > Paired Devices.

### Share History

View all your sent and received file transfers in the Share History sidebar:

1. Open via command palette: "Peer Share: Open share history"
2. Or from Settings > Peer Share > Share History > "Open History"
3. Browse transfers grouped by time (Today, Yesterday, This Week, etc.)
4. Search by filename, peer name, OS, or browser
5. Filter by direction (sent/received) and status (completed/failed/cancelled)
6. Export/import history for backup
7. View statistics and reveal received files in vault

## Settings

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Signaling Server URL** | WebSocket URL for peer discovery (default: `wss://pairdrop.net`) |
| **Save Location** | Folder where received files are saved (default: `Peer Share/`) |
| **Discovery Mode** | `Auto-discover` (local network + paired devices) or `Paired devices only` |
| **Log Level** | Console logging verbosity (Silent, Error, Warning, Info, Debug) |
| **Auto-connect on startup** | Automatically connect to server when Obsidian loads (default: enabled) |
| **System Notifications** | Show OS-level notifications for incoming transfers (desktop only, default: disabled) |
| **Paired Devices** | View and manage paired devices (each can have auto-accept enabled) |
| **Share History** | Configure history tracking, retention period, and privacy settings |

## Self-Hosted Server

You can use your own PairDrop signaling server for privacy or reliability:

1. See **[DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md)** for detailed hosting options including:
   - Docker (recommended)
   - Fly.io, Railway, Render (free tiers)
   - VPS with Nginx reverse proxy
2. Update the "Signaling Server URL" in plugin settings to your server's WebSocket URL

The signaling server only handles peer discovery - actual file data transfers directly between peers via WebRTC.

## How It Works

1. **Signaling**: Peers connect to a signaling server to discover each other
2. **WebRTC**: Once peers are found, a direct WebRTC connection is established
3. **Transfer**: Files are chunked into 64KB pieces and sent directly peer-to-peer
4. **Storage**: Received files are saved to your vault using Obsidian's API

Data flows directly between peers - the signaling server only facilitates the initial connection and never sees your file contents.

## Security

Peer Share uses **WebRTC's built-in encryption** (DTLS + SRTP) for secure peer-to-peer file transfers:

- ✅ **All file data is encrypted** during transfer (same encryption as Zoom/Google Meet)
- ✅ **Signaling uses WSS (WebSocket Secure)** - encrypted with TLS like HTTPS
- ✅ **Server never sees your files** - only connection metadata for peer discovery
- ✅ **No configuration needed** - encryption is automatic

For detailed security information, see **[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)**.

## Compatibility

- **Obsidian**: v1.0.0+
- **Platforms**: Desktop (Windows, macOS, Linux), Mobile (iOS, Android)
- **Peers**: Works with other Obsidian vaults and PairDrop web/mobile browser apps

## Troubleshooting

### Can't see peers
- Ensure both devices are connected to the same signaling server
- Check if you're behind a restrictive firewall (may need TURN server)
- Try the "Reconnect" button in settings

### Transfers failing
- Large files may timeout on slow connections
- Check your internet connection
- Try sending fewer files at once

### Connection issues
- WebRTC requires HTTPS for the signaling server
- Some corporate networks block WebRTC - try a different network
